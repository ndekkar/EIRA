    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CLIMADA?\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA is a fully probabilistic climate risk assessment tool. It provides a framework for users to combine exposure, hazard and vulnerability or impact data to calculate risk. Users can create probabilistic impact data from event sets, look at how climate change affects these impacts, and see how effectively adaptation measures can change them. CLIMADA also allows for studies of individual events, historical event sets and forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is highly customisable, meaning that users can work with out-of-the-box data provided for different hazards, population and economic exposure, or can provide their own data for part or all of the analysis. The pre-packaged data make CLIMADA particularly useful for users who focus on just one element of risk, since CLIMADA can 'fill in the gaps' for hazard, exposure or vulnerability in the rest of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model core is designed to give as much flexibility as possible when describing the elements of risk, meaning that CLIMADA isn't limited to particular hazards, exposure types or impacts. We love to see the model applied to new problems and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA provides classes, methods and data for exposure, hazard and impact functions (also called vulnerability functions), plus a financial model and a framework to analyse adaptation measures. Additional classes and data for common uses, such as economic exposures or tropical storms and tutorials for every class are available: see the [CLIMADA features](#CLIMADA-features) section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### This tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is for people new to CLIMADA who want to get a high level understanding of the model and work through an example risk analysis. It will list the current features of the model, and go through a complete CLIMADA analysis to give an idea of how the model works. Other tutorials go into more detail about different model components and individual hazards.\n",

    "## CLIMADA features\n",
    "\n",
    "A risk analysis with CLIMADA can include\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the statistical risk to your exposure from a set of events,\n",
    "2. how it changes under climate change, and\n",
    "3. a cost-benefit analysis of adaptation measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA is flexible: the \"statistical risk\" above could be describing the annual expected insured flood losses to a property portfolio, the number of people displaced by an ensemble of typhoon forecasts, the annual disruption to a railway network from landslides, or changes to crop yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users from risk-analysis backgrounds will be familiar with describing the impact of events by combining exposure, hazard and an impact function (or vulnerability curve) that combines the two to describe a hazard's effects. A CLIMADA analysis uses the same approach but wraps the exposures and their impact functions into a single `Entity` class, along with discount rates and adaptation options (see the below tutorials for more on CLIMADA's financial model).\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA's `Impact` object is used to analyse events and event sets, whether this is the impact of a single wildfire, or the global economic risk from tropical cyclones in 2100.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA is divided into two parts (two repositories): \n",
    "1. the core [climada_python](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) contains all the modules necessary for the probabilistic impact, the averted damage, uncertainty and forecast calculations. Data for hazard, exposures and impact functions can be obtained from the [data API](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_util_api_client.ipynb). [Litpop](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_entity_LitPop.ipynb) is included as demo Exposures module, and [Tropical cyclones](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.ipynb) is included as a demo Hazard module. \n",
    "2. the petals [climada_petals](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_petals) contains all the modules for generating data (e.g., TC_Surge, WildFire, OpenStreeMap, ...). Most development is done here. The petals builds-upon the core and does not work as a stand-alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CLIMADA classes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a full directory of tutorials for CLIMADA's classes to use as a reference. You don't need to read all this to do this tutorial, but it may be useful to refer back to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core (climada_python):\n",
    "- [**Hazard**](../tutorial/climada_hazard_Hazard.ipynb): a class that stores sets of geographic hazard footprints, (e.g. for wind speed, water depth and fraction, drought index), and metadata including event frequency. Several predefined extensions to create particular hazards from particular datasets and models are included with CLIMADA:\n",
    "   - [Tropical cyclone wind](../tutorial/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.ipynb): global hazard sets for tropical cyclone events, constructing statistical wind fields from storm tracks. Subclasses include methods and data to calculate historical wind footprints, create forecast enembles from ECMWF tracks, and create climatological event sets for different climate scenarios.\n",
    "   - [European windstorms](../tutorial/climada_hazard_StormEurope.ipynb): includes methods to read and plot footprints from the Copernicus WISC dataset and for DWD and ICON forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Entity**](#Entity): this is a container that groups CLIMADA's socio-economic models. It's is where the Exposures and Impact Functions are stored, which can then be combined with a hazard for a risk analysis (using the Engine's Impact class). It is also where Discount Rates and Measure Sets are stored, which are used in adaptation cost-benefit analyses (using the Engine's CostBenefit class):\n",
    "   - [Exposures](../tutorial/climada_entity_Exposures.ipynb): geolocated exposures. Each exposure is associated with a value (which can be a dollar value, population, crop yield, etc), information to associate it with impact functions for the relevant hazard(s) (in the Entity's ImpactFuncSet), a geometry, and other optional properties such as deductables and cover. Exposures can be loaded from a file, specified by the user, or created from regional economic models accessible within CLIMADA, for example: \n",
    "      - [LitPop](../tutorial/climada_entity_LitPop.ipynb): regional economic model using nightlight and population maps together with several economic indicators  \n",
    "      - [Polygons_lines](../tutorial/climada_entity_Exposures_polygons_lines.ipynb): use CLIMADA Impf you have your exposure in the form of shapes/polygons or in the form of lines.\n",
    "   - [ImpactFuncSet](../tutorial/climada_entity_ImpactFuncSet.ipynb): functions to describe the impacts that hazards have on exposures, expressed in terms of  e.g. the % dollar value of a building lost as a function of water depth, or the mortality rate for over-70s as a function of temperature. CLIMADA provides some common impact functions, or they can be user-specified. The following is an incomplete list:\n",
    "      - ImpactFunc: a basic adjustable impact function, specified by the user\n",
    "      - IFTropCyclone: impact functions for tropical cyclone winds\n",
    "      - IFRiverFlood: impact functions for river floods\n",
    "      - IFStormEurope: impact functions for European windstorms    \n",
    "   - [DiscRates](../tutorial/climada_entity_DiscRates.ipynb): discount rates per year\n",
    "   - [MeasureSet](../tutorial/climada_entity_MeasureSet.ipynb): a collection of Measure objects that together describe any adaptation measures being modelled. Adaptation measures are described by their cost, and how they modify exposure, hazard, and impact functions (and have have a method to do these things). Measures also include risk transfer options.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- [**Engine**](../tutorial/climada_engine_Impact.ipynb): the CLIMADA Engine contains the Impact and CostBenefit classes, which are where the main model calculations are done, combining Hazard and Entity objects.\n",
    "    - [Impact](../tutorial/climada_engine_Impact.ipynb): a class that stores CLIMADA's modelled impacts and the methods to calculate them from Exposure, Impact Function and Hazard classes. The calculations include average annual impact, expected annual impact by exposure item, total impact by event, and (optionally) the impact of each event on each exposure point. Includes statistical and plotting routines for common analysis products.\n",
    "    - [Impact_data](../tutorial/climada_engine_impact_data.ipynb): The core functionality of the module is to read disaster impact data as downloaded from the International Disaster Database EM-DAT (www.emdat.be) and produce a CLIMADA Impact()-instance from it. The purpose is to make impact data easily available for comparison with simulated impact inside CLIMADA, e.g. for calibration purposes.\n",
    "    - [CostBenefit](#Adaptation-options-appraisal): a class to appraise adaptation options. It uses an Entity's MeasureSet to calculate new Impacts based on their adjustments to hazard, exposure, and impact functions, and returns statistics and plotting routines to express cost-benefit comparisons.\n",
    "    - [Unsequa](../tutorial/climada_engine_unsequa.ipynb): a module for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "    - [Unsequa_helper](../tutorial/climada_engine_unsequa_helper.ipynb): The InputVar class provides a few helper methods to generate generic uncertainty input variables for exposures, impact function sets, hazards, and entities (including measures cost and disc rates). This tutorial complements the general tutorial on the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis module unsequa.\n",
    "    - [Forecast](../tutorial/climada_engine_Forecast.ipynb): This class deals with weather forecasts and uses CLIMADA ImpactCalc.impact() to forecast impacts of weather events on society. It mainly does one thing: It contains all plotting and other functionality that are specific for weather forecasts, impact forecasts and warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "climada_petals:\n",
    "- [**Hazard**](../tutorial/climada_hazard_Hazard.ipynb):\n",

    "    - [River flooding](https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/climada_hazard_RiverFlood.html): global water depth hazard for flood, including methods to work with ISIMIP simulations.\n",
    "    - [Crop modelling](https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/climada_hazard_entity_Crop.html): combines ISIMIP crop simulations and UN Food and Agrigultre Organization data. The module uses crop production as exposure, with hydrometeorological 'hazard' increasing or decreasing production.\n",
    "    - [Wildfire (global)](https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/climada_hazard_Wildfire.html): This class is used to model the wildfire hazard using the historical data available and creating synthetic fires which are summarized into event years to establish a comprehensiv probabilistic risk assessment.\n",
    "    - [Landslide](https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/climada_hazard_Landslide.html): This class is able to handle two different types of landslide source files (in one case, already the finished product of some model output, in the other case just a historic data collection).\n",
    "    - [TCForecast](https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/climada_hazard_TCForecast.html): This class extends the TCTracks class with methods to download operational ECMWF ensemble tropical storm track forecasts, read the BUFR files they're contained in and produce a TCTracks object that can be used to generate TropCyclone hazard footprints.\n",
    "    - [Emulator](https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/climada_hazard_emulator.html):Given a database of hazard events, this module climada.hazard.emulator provides tools to subsample events (or time series of events) from that event database.\n",

Pre-calculated hazards can be loaded from files (see the [full Hazard tutorial](climada_hazard_Hazard.ipynb), but they can also be modelled from a storm track using the `TCTracks` class, based on a storm's parameters at each time step. This is how we'll construct the hazards for our example.\n",
